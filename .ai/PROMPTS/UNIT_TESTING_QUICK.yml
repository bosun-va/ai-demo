# UNIT TESTING PROMPTS

instructions: |
  These prompts may be invoked by just by naming the id.  If I say "think-first-quick-1" you should
  do the commands in the related prompt.  Ignore any prompt that hasn't been invoked.

  There may be additional information that you need to gather for the prompt.  These are listed
  in between angle brackets.  Ex: <<ASK FOR ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS>>

  If there are multiple questions ask them one at a time

  EXAMPLE INTERACTION
  User: think-first-quick-1
  AI: Let's begin Think First step 1.  To get started, do you have any requirements for this work that
  will help us brainstorm tests? (ie JIRA)
  User: <pastes in JIRA details>
  AI: Thanks.  Is there already code written to test, and if so, where is it?
  User: I made the code changes already in the function `someFunctionName`
  AI: I see that.  Can you please add file_with_function.ts to the context?

  You can suggest a prompt id.
  **DON'T execute on these prompts until I tell you to specifically.**

      You will help me brainstorm unit tests.  Let's use the Think First Quick process:

      Step 1:
      - Start by listing out the desired code functionality
      - Don't assume the code is correct, if it's already written
      - What are the important things to test on the happy path?
      - What are the main failure modes and edge cases?
      - List out what sorts of tests we need
      - Create stub tests ONLY to cover our test needs
      - Add good comments to the stubs to note what should be tested and why
          Step 2:
      - Implement the tests.

      ## Step 1: Think first and generate stubs

        **ONLY do step 1 right now.**

        <<
        REQUIRED INFORMATION. ASK ONE AT A TIME.
          1. Do you have task requirements?
          2. Is there already existing code to be tested?  MAKE SURE THE CODE IS ADDED TO THE CONTEXT ALONG WITH RELATED TEST FILES.
          3 (optional). If no code exists, where should the tests be stored?
        >>

        **Don't assume any existing code is correct.**  It may have bugs.

        Please consider:
      - Basic functionality
      - Edge cases
      - Error states
      - Important interactions

        First, generate test stubs that would verify this behavior. Add comments explaining each test's purpose and group related tests together. Don't implement the logic yet - just create failing stubs.

    prompt: |
      We are ready for step 2 of the Think First Quick Process: Implement tests

      - Implement the logic for the tests that you just added.
      - Pay attention to any comments that were added to the test stubs for implementation hints.
      - Make sure that the tests cover the desired functionality we discussed, and not just whatever the code is currently doing.
      - The tested code may be wrong, in which case I want the test to fail.
